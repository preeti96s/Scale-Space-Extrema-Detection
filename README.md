# Scale-Space-Extrema-Detection
Implementing first step of SIFT
Performing sclae space extrema detection on two images (Book.png and Building.png) and finding the relevant keypoints that can be used to describe features of the images.

Here we are performing different transformations(rotation, scaling, adding noise ,etc) - data augmentation on the images and then checking how the quality of keypoints is changing.
